# Tumblr Boilerplate

This is a fully constructed template to help speed up the development of Tumblr themes. The goal was to remove redundant tags and use the least amount code to maintain easy theme development.

## Features 


* HTML5
* Supports most post-types
* Localization strings

__Does not support__

* Notes
* Photoset post-type (Merged with video post-type)
* Group Blogs (Coming soon as a branch)

These were consciously not included to expedite the workflow.
